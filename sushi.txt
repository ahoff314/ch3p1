Review the General Programming Assignment instructions.
The manager of a football stadium wants you to write a program that calculates the total ticket sales
after each game. There are four types of ticketsâ€”box, sideline, premium, and general admission.

After each game, data is stored in a file in the following form:

ticketPrice       numberOfTicketsSold
...
Sample data are shown below:
250             5750
100           28000
50           35750
25           18750
The first line indicates that the ticket price is $250 and that 5750 tickets were sold at that price.
Output the total number of tickets sold and the total sale amount into an output file.
Format your output with two decimal places. (You are required to generate an output file that has the results.)
